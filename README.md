Projects from UNLV

This repo is essentially a catch-all portfolio of some of my programming highlights from my undergraduate work.
To be found in here specifically is work from the following courses at UNLV:
CS 302 (Data Structures) taken in Spr 2017
CS 458 (Intro to Data Mining) taken in Spr 2018
MATH 365 (Computational Linear Algebra) taken in Spr 2018
CS 769 (Advanced Database Systems) taken in Spr 2019

As well as a few other side projects. 
This is mostly very base-level code but should demonstrate proficiency with Object-Oriented programming, C++ and Python.
