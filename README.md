Projects from UNLV

This repo is essentially a catch-all portfolio of some of my programming highlights from my undergraduate work.
To be found in here specifically is work from the following courses at UNLV:

CS 302 (Data Structures) taken in Spr 2017

CS 458 (Intro to Data Mining) taken in Spr 2018

CS 769 (Advanced Database Systems) taken in Spr 2019


As well as a few other side projects. 
This is mostly very base-level code but should demonstrate proficiency with Object-Oriented programming, C++ and Python.
Some of this code is suboptimal and represents my first forays into the topics demonstrated.
